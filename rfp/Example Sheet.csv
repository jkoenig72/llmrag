,1,Communications Cloud,Communications Cloud,Communications Cloud,"In your Order Managment OM module, do you support the concept of a Point of no return PONR.",FC,"Yes, we support the concept of a Point of No Return (PONR) in our Order Management module within the Communications Cloud. You can configure PONR at the order or item level, preventing further modifications once an order or item reaches a specific status. Once a PONR is reached, it cannot be reversed, even if the order or item is voided or canceled, ensuring a clear and irreversible point in the order lifecycle. The PONR feature is fully supported through standard configuration and can be set to trigger at various statuses like 'Completed', 'Running', 'Failed', or 'Fatally Failed'. For order items, the 'Force Supplementals' option (available in the Spring '22 release) can be used to override the PONR. The system proactively notifies CPQ and provides an API to query the PONR status of an order. Cancel requests are submitted in reverse order of initial execution, and rollback plans are generated as per defined rules. For assetized items, contact Vlocity for an un-assetize orchestration item implementation.

It automatically converts incoming emails into cases, capturing sender's details and email content. To enable, go to 'Service Settings' > 'Email-to-Case Settings'. For enhanced security, configure accepting emails from specific domains or IP addresses, which may require additional setup but remains FC. To support replies to these cases via email, set up the 'Auto-Response Rules' feature, which is also FC. This functionality requires Professional, Enterprise, or Unlimited editions, as stated in the 'Required Editions' section.

Both technical integration workflows and also Screenflows.,FC,"Salesforce enables workflow modeling through Process Builder for technical integration and Screen Flows for user interface. Process Builder automates record updates and triggers flows based on criteria, accessible through standard features. Screen Flows are low-code, user-friendly tools for creating screens with fields, actions, and validations. To enhance data safety in Screen and Autolaunched Flows running in System context, validate inputs and outputs, check for null values, and ensure proper error handling. Restrict user access to data in Screen Flows using record-level access and field-level security. Additionally, specify required fields in Get Records elements and ensure compatibility with Experience Cloud Sites by defining fields and records within flows.

If so, please describe how it works.",FC,"Sales Cloud supports a robust Lead to Opportunity conversion process. When a lead is qualified, it can be converted into an opportunity with a single click, using the built-in conversion process (FC). During conversion, Sales Cloud allows for custom field mapping (PC), enabling businesses to control which lead data is transferred to the new opportunity record. After conversion, the lead record can be either deleted or archived, based on your configuration (FC). Sales Cloud also offers a bulk lead conversion feature (FC), allowing multiple leads to be converted into opportunities simultaneously. Additionally, Sales Cloud provides customizable sales stages (FC), enabling businesses to tailor their sales pipeline to match their specific sales process.

,6,Communications Cloud,Communications Cloud,Communications Cloud,What are the options to implement product catalog synchronization from an external source. How can we sync up with an external Product catalog.,PC,"Product catalog synchronization from an external source in Communications Cloud can be achieved via Application Connectors (FC) or Custom Connectors (PC), as previously mentioned. However, for complex syncing like specific objects and fields, it may require custom development (PC). Salesforce supports syncing from specific objects like Orchestration Item, Order, Order Item, Product, Quote Line Item, and Quote Member. Syncing custom objects and fields not natively supported may require custom development or third-party tools (NC). Additionally, syncing real-time data may not be feasible with current Salesforce features and might necessitate integrating with external ETL tools (NA). To automate the process, consider using the 'External Quote Line Items Data' template to create an app.
