Salesforce Documentation Crawler package.

A production-grade, multithreaded documentation crawler designed 
to build a high-quality, offline-ready markdown dataset for 
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems like LangChain.

This package is optimized for Salesforce and MuleSoft documentation,
but is extendable to other documentation sources. It includes support
for various page types including standard help articles, Apex help pages,
and Trailhead learning content.
